This past week I participated in Flatiron's campus recruiting event. The structure of the event is as follows:
You are paired up with three to five companies that will interview you over the course of the week. There is also a possibility that you will have two interviews scheduled on the same day. The companies are all of different backgrounds with the only thing in common being that there is a skill or quality that on your resume that is in line with what the company is looking for. For example I have a BA in Economics so I was paired with a few FinTech companies. You are not given much information about the company except their name and the interviewerâ€™s name. However that should be all the information you need to prepare for any interview.

I was able to learn a lot about the art of interviewing during the week. It was slightly stressful at first but by the third interview I was very relax and knew my way around many of the popular interview questions. This also helped improved my programming knowledge as some interviews were very technical. I enjoyed hearing about the different company missions and current challenges. This gave me good insight of their place and what they are doing to impact the industry. This information also helped me to visualize where I would fit in with the company and if they are right for me.

Overall I thought this was a great learning experience.
